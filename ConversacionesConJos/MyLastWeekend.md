# My last weekend was amazing

From the moment I woke up, I felt that the day was going to be wonderful. It was a very bright Saturday, the sun was incandescent but the morning felt fresh, perfect to go for a walk or jogging, and even though I didn't do any of these physical activities, I was able to enjoy a great moment with my girlfriend, because we decided to go for breakfast at Paramos Cafe. It wasn't planned, just when I woke up I received (got) a message from Maria telling me she wanted to invite me (take me out) for breakfast at Paramos Cafe, it was about 8 am and when I read the message I got up quickly and I took a shower, I put on my strawberry-scented shampoo, I brushed my teeth, I felt clean and I felt that I smelled good, I wanted to captivate Maria.

I went to pick maria up at her house, there, I saw her mom who was worried that it was going to be 9 am and we still hadn't had breakfast. I said hello to her and I told her not to worry, we would go to Paramos Cafe for breakfast, I said bye and we left.

We got to Paramos around 9:30 am and ordered 2 criontsants for me, a sandwich for Maria and one coffee for each one of us. We waited around 30 minutes and while we were talking about a new tv series that come out on Netflix called "My Baby Reindeer".

After that, we went to Sabana Grande to go with my friend Carlos to Have his hair cut.

We went up to Traki on the food court and had a steack sandwich for lunch and a very tasty "house sauce" which I highly recommend. we spent the whole afternoon talking with Carlos and when it was already half past seven in the evening we went back to the house.

At about 9 pm Maria and I watched the My Baby Reindeer series until 1 am, then went to the bed and slept until the next morning.
